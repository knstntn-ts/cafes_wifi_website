# Coffee shops API
Simple website with coffe shops. Built using Flask and SQLite. Implemented the CRUD functionality to change the information or add more entries.

This project was mainly written for the purpose of polishing skills for using python to manage backend operation of a website. I do not plan to polish the website itself further.
